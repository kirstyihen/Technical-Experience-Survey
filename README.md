# Technical-Experience-Survey
I wanted to create a survey that recorded the technical skills of a prospective applicant. 
The design for this form is simple and straightforward in order to align with the nature of the task.
The input boxes were made through the form tag in html which is class that enables taking in user input. 
My customer would be any company that was in need of developers. My products allows companies to be able to 
ask developers about their skillset. Next steps for this project is another file to store the input from this file 
so that a company can use the inputs from this file.
